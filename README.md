## About

This Project is to show my portfolio to potential employers. This page includes projects I've created, ways to contact me, and a brief summary of myself.


## Usage

This page is mainly going to be used by employers, but also by me to show potential clients if I want to freelance. This page serves as a one stop shop to knowing about me and my webdevelopment journey.
